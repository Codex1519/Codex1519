# 👋 Hi, I'm @Chawasch 

Welcome to my GitHub space – where logic meets creativity 💡💻  
I'm passionate about solving problems, building tools, and crafting clean code that works.  
Whether it's backend logic or frontend flair – I love bringing ideas to life through code.

I started my coding journey in **2024** and I'm currently in the early stages of my development career.  
I'm especially interested in building projects using **Java** and **Python**, and I'm currently learning the ropes in **web development**.
